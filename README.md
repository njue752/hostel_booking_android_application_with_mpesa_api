This is an android application that i built as my final project for a course i did  in android application development at emobilis tech institute in Nairobi.The android app is fully functional complete with mpesa api integration.It allows users to login to the app once they signup and then they can view the different houses that are up for letting,the houses are displayed using lazy rows and they come with a google map and a description of the house so the user can be fully informed of the house details including the location of the house.The user can then go ahead and book the house by submitting theit details through a form .They then pay a standard booking fee of 500 ksh.I developed the app as a way of tring to find a solution to the physical  house hunting process.
